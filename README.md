# Initial-Portfolio
The first iteration of my professional web developer portfolio. 

My plan of attack for this assignment was to completely sketch and flesh the webapge out and then return with the responsive design. That proved to be a mis-step as returning to making things responsive ending up being a giant task considering all of the moving parts I had already in place. I have learned that responsive-design should be considered immediately and throughout the process to make life easier and to generally leverage time mgmt better. 

While I did not succeed in making it 100% responsive, I am very proud of the overall flow, layout and design of my first website. All links in the nav-bar, all contact links and links through the refactor image correctly redirect. Also the main image grows on hover. Besides some slight adjustments to images, I believe it looks polished and has a strong thematic presence with tasteful styling throughout. 

Having spent many, many hours on this assignment (I had to delete the original repo I had last week), I know that a little more work needs to be done. I would like to go back and clean up the CSS, scrap the 'float-lefts' and replace them with flex commands and @media queries. Also, revisting some of my margins, heights and widths. 

Thank you for your time!
