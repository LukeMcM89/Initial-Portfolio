                <h2> Hi, I'm Luke McMurtrie!</h2>
                <br>
                <p> Thank you for taking the time to consider my portfolio! This is the <em>first</em> iteration of my
                    professional web-developer portfolio.<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm 31 years old and currently call Richmond, Virginia my home. Although I was raised here, I earned
                    my Bachelor's in English Literature and Writing from
                    Holy Cross College in Notre Dame, Indiana in 2012. My passions include music (I'm a self-taught
                    guitar and synthesizer player),
                    painting, photography, poetry... all things art really. It may also be important to note my
                    obsession with dinosaurs, lightsabers, Leonardo da Vinci, technology, space, stand-up comedy,
                    nature,
                    philosophy, psychology, cooking, the elusive study of conciousness and what it means to be awake and
                    aware.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oh, and I'm a rookie chess player; thanks to one of my younger brothers who has me hooked but
                    constantly enjoys serving me ice-cold, painful and <em>frequent</em> losses.
                </p>

                        projects
                        and
                        work.
                        For now, it's verging on 404... but not for long!

                        It is my intention, in the <em>near-future</em>, for this section to be more well-rounded and
                        robust.
                        However, I'd like to take
                        the opportunity <em>now</em> to thank you once again for your time and consideration!
