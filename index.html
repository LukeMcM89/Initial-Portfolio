            <h2> Hi, I'm Luke McMurtrie!</h2>
            <p> Thank you for taking the time to consider my portfolio! This is the <em>first</em> iteration of my professional web-developer portfolio.<br>
                <br>
                I'm 31 years old and currently call Richmond, Virginia my home. Although I was raised here, I earned my Bachelor's in English Literature and Writing from 
                Holy Cross College in Notre Dame, Indiana in 2012. My passions include music (I'm a self-taught guitar and synthesizer player),
                painting, photography, poetry... all things art really. It may also be important to note my obsession with dinosaurs, lightsabers, Leonardo da Vinci, technology, space, stand-up comedy, nature, 
                philosophy, psychology, cooking, the elusive study of conciousness and what it means to be awake and aware. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Oh, and I'm a rookie chess player; thanks to one of my younger brothers who has me hooked but constantly enjoys serving me ice-cold, painful and <em>frequent</em> losses.

            <h2></h2>
            <p>This area is designated to most humbly showcase and highlight a selection of my programming projects and work.
                For now, it's verging on 404... but not for long! 
                <br>
                <br>
                It is my intention, in the <em>near-future</em>, for this section to be more well-rounded and robust. However, I'd like to take
                the opportunity <em>now</em> to thank you once again for your time and consideration!
